$PSXN,20,horiz-qual,hgt-qual,head-qual,rp-qual*csum term
$PSXN,22,gyro-calib,gyro-offs*csum term
$PSXN,23,roll,pitch,head,heave*csum term
$PSXN,24,roll-rate,pitch-rate,yaw-rate,vertical-vel*csum term
$PSXN,21,event*csum term

Where:

horiz-qual: Horizontal position and velocity quality: 0 = normal, 1 = reduced performance, 2= invalid data.
hgt-qual: Height and vertical velocity quality: 0 = normal, 1 = reduced performance, 2 =invalid data.
head-qual: Heading quality: 0 = normal, 1 = reduced performance, 2 = invalid data.
rp-qual: Roll and pitch quality: 0 = normal, 1 = reduced performance, 2 = invalid data.
gyro-calib: Gyro calibration value since system start-up in degrees on format d.dd.
gyro-offs: Short-term gyro offset in degrees on format d.dd.
roll: Roll in degrees on format d.dd. Positive with port side up.
pitch: Pitch in degrees on format d.dd. Positive with bow up.
heave: Heave in metres on format d.dd. Positive down.
roll-rate: Roll rate in degrees per second on format d.dd. Positive when port side is moving upwards.
pitch-rate: Pitch rate in degrees per second on format d.dd. Positive when bow is moving upwards.
yaw-rate: Yaw rate in degrees per second on format d.dd. Positive when bow is moving towards starboard.
vertical-vel: Vertical velocity in metres per second on format d.dd. Positive when moving downwards.
event: Event code: 1 = system restart.
csum: Checksum (exclusive or) of all characters between, but not including, the preceding $ and * , hexadecimal (00 - FF).
term: CR-LF (2 bytes, values 13 and 10).
